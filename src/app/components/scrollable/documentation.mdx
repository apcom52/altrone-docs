# Usage

  If you have large content on the page (like List with a lot of elements) you need to wrap this content into `<Scrollable>` component.
  You need to set `maxHeight` (or `maxWidth` in case of horizontal direction) to set maximum size of the content.

  When your content takes up less space than `maxHeight` (or `maxWidth`) then the container works like usual `<Flex>` container.

    <Playground code={`import { Scrollable, Text } from 'altrone-ui';

<Scrollable maxHeight="300px">
