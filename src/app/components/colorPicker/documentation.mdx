# Usage

This component could be used in two modes: pick a color from the gallery (set of predefined colors) or pick a color from the RGB palette. 
You can choose only one mode or both.

In gallery mode you need to provide a list of colors. When color picker is opened, it will show a list of colors and user can pick one of them.

In RGB mode (we call it "palette" mode) you don't need to provide any colors. When color picker is opened, it will show a palette, where user can pick a color by clicking on it.
User can also pick a color by typing a value in the input field. Also user can set opacity of the color.
