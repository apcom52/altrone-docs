  # Usage

  This is the main wrapper for your application. To incorporate Altrone styles and utilize its components, you need to
  wrap your application in this High-Order component.

  If you want to build entire application via Altrone you need to wrap you application as body (you can specify
  necessary tag using `tagName` property). If you want to use Altrone into only a specific place you can wrap only
  this specific place.

  By wrapping your application with the `<AltroneApplication>` component, you can provide
  configuration settings for internal components. Each Altrone component includes its own set of configuration fields.
  You can override these configuration settings later using `<Configuration>` component.

  # Theming

  Altrone offers two distinct themes: light and dark. You can choose a specific theme or use the system theme.
  Each Altrone component adapts its colors according to the selected theme.

  To implement theming feature for your own components you can use `.AltroneDark` selector in your css styles
  (this class is applied to your `<AltroneApplication>` wrapper when the dark theme is selected).
