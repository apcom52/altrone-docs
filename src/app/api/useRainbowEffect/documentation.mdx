  # Usage

  This hook is used to implement rainbow effect in your custom components. It returns object of properties which you need
  to pass into your interactive element.

  First argument of the hook is `enabled`. When you don't need this effect you can pass `false`. The default value is `true`.

  In case when you need some custom event handlers for this interactive element you can pass them into the second hook's argument.
  Also you can set custom opacity and blur for the effect.

  <CodeBlock children={`import { useRainbowEffect } from "altrone-ui"

const rainbowProps = useRainbowEffect(true, {
  onMouseEnter: () => console.log('mouse enter'),
  onMouseMove:  () => console.log('mouse move'),
  onMouseLeave:  () => console.log('mouse leave'),
  onWheel:  () => console.log('wheel'),
  onFocus:  () => console.log('focus'),
  opacity: 1,
  blur: 11,
});
