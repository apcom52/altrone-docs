  # Date filters for DataTable

  <div className={s.GifContainer}>
    <Image src={DateFiltersPicture} alt="Notification example" width={800} height={400} className={s.Gif} />
  </div>

  In this release we added new date filters for `date`, `month` and `year` column types. Using these filters you can filter your dataset by specific date or date range.
  Also now you can subscribe to filters, sort and page changes and provide default filters, sort and page. With these features you can create a powerful and flexible data table and save user preferences between sessions.
