  # New Design System

  Altrone has been fully redesigned. Previous design system has some limitations and was not flexible enough, also some components
  were not consistent with each other. In the third version, Altrone was rewritten from the scratch. A new design system, new methods
  of working with components, and new component properties were introduced. Now Altrone is more flexible and powerful.

  Now you can easily customize the appearance of components, change the color scheme, and create your own themes using new CSS variables.
  In this release we have added the first set of CSS variables - colors, typography, and spacing. In the future, we plan to add more CSS variables.

  Also, now you can pass custom className and styles to every component. This allows you to customize the appearance of components in a more flexible way.
  Using new [Configuration](/components/configuration) wrapper you can pass custom classNames or styles to all child components.

  # Rainbow Hover Effect

  <div className={s.GifContainer}>
    <Image src={GifRainbow} alt="Rainbow Hover Effect" width={366} height={206} className={s.Gif} />
  </div>

  As a part of the new design system, we have added a new feature - Rainbow Hover Effect. This effect allows you to add a rainbow hover effect
  to interactive elements (like buttons or text fields). This effect is visible only when user hovers over the element.

  You can also use this new effect in your custom components. To use this effect you need to import [useRainbowEffect](/api/useRainbowEffect) hook.
  <CodeBlock>{`import { useRainbowEffect } from "altrone-ui";

function MyComponent() {
  const rainbowProps = useRainbowEffect();

  return <div {...rainbowProps}>...</div>
}`}</CodeBlock>

  # React Subcomponents

  We decided to transform some component props into subcomponents. This allows you to pass more complex data to components
  and makes the code more readable. For example, TextInput islands were transformed into subcomponents. Look how it works:

  This is how you can add an action to the TextInput component in the 2.0 version:
  <CodeBlock>{`<TextInput
  rightIsland={{
    type: InputIslandType.icon,
    content: <Icon i="search" />
  }}
  ...
/>`}</CodeBlock>

  And this is how you can add an action to the TextInput component in the 3.0 version:
  <CodeBlock>{`<TextInput>
  <TextInput.IconIsland icon={<Icon i="search" />} />
</TextInput>`}</CodeBlock>

  This change opens up new possibilities for working with components: you can wrap child subcomponents into [Popover](/components/popover),
  [Tooltip](/components/tooltip) (or any other component) or use conditional rendering.
