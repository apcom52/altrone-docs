  # Migration to v3.5

  Altrone 3.5 is fully compatible with Altrone 3.4. 

  In this release we changed design of glass surfaces. We made it more transparent and for some cases in your application you may need to update your styles to improve readability.

  # Next steps
  
  This is the last release in the Altrone 3 series. In the next major version we will introduce new components and features.

  We will continue to release bug fixes for the 3rd generation Altrone right up to the release of version 4. 
  The 4th generation will contain some breaking changes, but we will do our best to ensure the smoothest migration possible.
